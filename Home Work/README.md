## Data Structures
Messy but usable.

#### Midterm
> 01: HW2ANS - Dynamic Array <br>
> 02: HW3ANS - Linked List (Singly,Doubly <= with tail and without) <br>
> 03: HW4ANS - Stack and Queue implement on trading calculate Realized,Unrealized Profit/Loss <br>
> 04: HW5ANS - Tree BFT, DFT by Stack and Queue <br>

#### Final
> 05: hw6 - Binary Search Trees<br>
> 06: hw7 - AVLTree, SplayTree, Binary Search Tree (non-recursive version) [+] Merge, Split, Rotation, Rebalance <br>
> 07: hw8 - Stock Market Simulation [Priority Queues with Binary Min-Heaps -> (Array as complete binary trees) ] <br>
> 08: hw9 - Hash Table (Polynomial Hashing, Quadratic Probing) & Graph (Hashed Graph, DFS, BFS, ShortestPath)
